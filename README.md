This project focuses on predicting the behavior of the S&P500 Market behavior due to speeches made by the Federal Reserve. Speeches were taken from the [Federal Reserve's Speeches of Federal Reserve Officials](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speeches.htm) page. Market behavior was taken using Yahoo Finance. 

This project allowed me to further enhance my understanding of Neural Networks and AI as I personally created and reconfigured my own Neural Network to see how it compared to that from transformers. It also helped give me a lot of experience analyzing performance and visualizing the data.
